//It implements the algorithm / logic of "calculateBillAmount" method in "iDiscountCalculator" 
//This class is concerned about the type of discount to be applied. In this case 22% discount on MRP. 

//Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. 
//Logic of this algorithm can vary, oblivious to the client that uses it
